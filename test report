                                    TEST REPORT-PAULA GARCIA RAMOS

This project is divided in three levels that have different exercises, each of them has been tested separately
to check its correct work and then they have been added together in the server.py file.


BASIC LEVEL

The endpoints required for this practice are: /, /listSpecies, /karyotype, /chrlength.
Each one has been firstly tested with the example given by the API rest page and then using our own requests.
If we open the browser and write "http://localhost:8000/" we enter into the main page in which we have all the
available options:
With /listSpecies endpoint:
    -List of all species: "http://localhost:8000/listSpecies"
    -Limit(list of a limited number of species): If we write 4 we get "http://localhost:8000/listSpecies?limit=4"
